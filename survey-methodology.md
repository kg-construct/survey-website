## Criteria

We consider the following inclusion and exclusion criteria 
during our systematic literature review to include or exclude an article:

### Inclusion criteria

- Articles published from the first published recommendation of RDF in 1999
  until 2021.
- Articles written in English.
- Articles describing approaches and implementations related to:
  - Generating knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data sources.
  - Describing implementations and optimizations of existing knowledge 
    graph generation approaches.
  - Specifying schema or data transformation for heterogeneous data.

### Exclusion criteria

- Articles which are not published or peer-reviewed.
- Articles written in another language than English.
- Technical reports, demo papers, posters, PhD consortium papers, and 
  presentations.
- Commercialized approaches and implementations.

This systematic literature review was performed independently by 3 authors.

## Step 1: Collecting articles

We created a list of terms by breaking down our research sub-questions into 
individual facets and their alternative spelling, synonyms and abbreviations. 
These terms were combined together with Boolean `AND` and `OR` operators
and used by each reviewer when searching for relevant articles.
We avoided to use these terms individually because they were too broad
which resulted in an enormous number of results.
The following terms and combinations were considered in this systematic review:

- `("knowledge graph" OR "knowledge graphs") AND ("definition" OR "definitions")`
- `("RDF" OR "Resource Description Framework") AND "heterogeneous data"`
- `("transformation" OR "transformations") AND "heterogeneous data"`
- `("answer" OR "answers" OR "answering") AND ("query" OR "queries")`
- `("Resource Description Framework" OR "RDF") AND ("stream" OR "streams" OR "streaming")`
- `("Linked Data" OR "Linked Open Data" OR "LOD" OR "knowledge graph" OR "knowledge graphs") AND "generation"`
- `("Linked Data" OR "Linked Open Data" OR "LOD" OR "knowledge graph" OR "knowledge graphs") AND "construction"`
- `"SPARQL" AND ("generation" OR "construction")`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND ("RDB" OR "relational database" OR "relational databases")`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND "heterogeneous data"`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND ("function" OR "functions")`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND ("transformation" OR "transformations")`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND ("RDF" OR "Resource Description Framework")`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND ("knowledge graph" OR "knowledge graphs" OR "Linked Data" OR "Linked Open Data" OR "LOD")`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND ("knowledge graph" OR "knowledge graphs" OR "Linked Data" OR "Linked Open Data" OR "LOD") AND ("generation" OR "construction")`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND "SPARQL"`
- `("Linked Data" OR "Linked Open Data" OR "LOD") AND ("mapping language" OR "mapping languages")`
- `("mapping language" OR "mapping languages") AND "R2RML"`
- `("generation" OR "construction") AND "R2RML" AND ("knowledge graph" OR "knowledge graphs" OR "Linked Data" OR "Linked Open Data" OR "LOD")`
- `("stream" OR "streams" OR "streaming") AND ("RDF" OR "Resource Description Framework") AND "SPARQL"`

## Step 2: Review titles & abstracts
We searched for these terms in the article's title and abstract 
to avoid a high number of irrelevant articles in comparison 
to searching in the article's full text.
An article is selected when at least one of the combined terms has been found
in the title or abstract of an article.
We searched for our terms in 42 sources ranging from journals, conferences and 
digital libraries.
We retrieved 1884 articles which are potentially relevant for this survey paper.

## Step 3: Applying additional search strategies

We also enriched our review list by following additional search strategies 
to include more relevant articles:

1. reviewing references of potentially relevant articles
2. adding manually relevant articles.

We searched for potentially relevant articles through the references 
of other relevant articles. 
This way, we discovered 3 more potentially relevant articles. 
We also manually added 3 more articles which we found relevant for this survey.
This result in 1735 articles in total.
We indicated these 6 articles in the tables below with a '*'.

## Step 4: Reviewing potential articles for inclusion

We manually reviewed the retrieved potentially relevant articles
among reviewers.
The reviewers verified the article's relevance
for this systematic literature review and
applied our inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
This resulted in 52 relevant articles for this survey paper.
18 articles introduce or extend a mapping language (ML) for 
transforming heterogeneous data into a knowledge graph.
16 articles introduce data transformations (DT) or align them
with a mapping language for heterogeneous data.
21 articles describe a materialization tool (MT),
and 18 articles a virtualization tool (VT)
for transforming heterogeneous data into a knowledge graph.
12 articles were submitted to workshops, 27 to conferences, and 13 to journals.
